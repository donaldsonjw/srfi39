* SRFI-39: Parameter Objects

** Description
  The srfi39 library is an implementation of [[https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-39/srfi-39.html][SRFI 39]] for Bigloo
  scheme. It is heavily based on the example implementation provided
  by Marc Feeley.

** Building
  Both the bigloo native and jvm backends are supported. To build,
  execute:
    #+begin_src shell
  ./configure --prefix=<installation path prefix>; make
#+end_src
  where =<installation path prefix> is the desired installation path
  prefix (e.g, =/usr/local=). You usually want the path prefix to match
  that used for Bigloo itself.

** Installation
  To install the library, execute:
#+begin_src shell
  make install
#+end_src 

** Tests
  To run the tests, you will need to install [[https://github.com/donaldsonjw/btest][btest]]. Once this is done,
  tests can be executed with:

  #+begin_src shell
  make test
#+end_src
